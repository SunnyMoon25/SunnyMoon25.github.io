            This mockumentary follows the everyday lives of the manager and the
            employees he "manages." The crew follows the employees around 24/7
            and captures their quite humorous and bizarre encounters as they
            will do what it takes to keep the company thriving. This U.S.
            adaptation -- set at a paper company in Scranton, Pa.

            Earl has taken one too many wrong turns on the highway of life as a

            as he sets out to right all the wrongs from his past. Despite his
            seemingly limited intelligence, he is oddly effective -- and has a
            voice and style all his own.

            Jimmy Chance, a 23-year-old man who skims pools for a living, has a
            chance romantic encounter with Lucy, a wanted felon. When he visits
            Lucy in prison months later, Jimmy discovers that she gave birth to
            a baby he must now raise -- with his family's help. Jimmy's family
            includes his parents, who have no interest in helping to raise their
            grandchild, and his grandmother, Maw Maw, who can barely care for
            herself ... let alone a baby.

            Based on chef Eddie Huang's best-selling memoir of the same name,
            "Fresh Off the Boat" takes a humorous look at the lives of
            immigrants in America. In the 1990s, Eddie, a hip-hop-loving
            11-year-old, relocates with his parents and two brothers to suburban
            Orlando from the Chinatown section of Washington, D.C. As Eddie's
            dad, Louis, pursues the American dream by opening a Western-themed
            restaurant named Cattleman's Ranch Steakhouse, Eddie and the rest of
            the family try to acclimate to their new, strange surroundings.

            An oddball family of employees at supersized megastore Cloud 9
            tackles the day-to-day grind of rabid bargain hunters, riot-causing
            sales and nap-worthy training sessions. Stalwart employee Amy is
            just trying to hold it all together despite the best efforts of her
            daftly clueless manager Glen and his iron-fisted assistant Dina.
            Rounding out the crew is new hire Jonah, a dreamy dreamer, sardonic
            Garrett, ambitious Mateo and sweet young mother-to-be Cheyenne. From
            bright-eyed newbies to seen-it-all veterans, bumbling seasonal hires
            and in-it-for-life managers, they're all going to get through
            another day -- together.
